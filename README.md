## 🚀 Features & Functionality
✔️ **Remote Control** – Turn the heater ON/OFF from anywhere via a smartphone or web app.  
✔️ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Track water temperature and device status (connected/disconnected).  
✔️ **Automated Shutdown** – The system automatically turns off when the desired temperature is reached.  
✔️ **Scheduled Activation** – Users can schedule when to turn the heater on/off based on local time.  
✔️ **Notifications & Alerts** – Receive alerts when water is heated or if the temperature exceeds a safety limit.  
✔️ **Energy Efficiency** – Helps reduce electricity waste, saving costs and resources.

## 📊 **System Architecture**
The Smart Electric Heater system consists of **three main components**:

1️⃣ **Relay & Temperature Sensors** – Monitor water temperature and heating status.  
2️⃣ **IoT Communication (MQTT Broker)** – Facilitates secure communication between the heater and user devices.  
3️⃣ **Central Controller** – Manages system operations and sends notifications.  

**📡 Workflow:**  
- The **sensor** measures water temperature and sends real-time data.  
- The **central controller** processes this data and checks if the temperature reaches the desired level.  
- Users receive **real-time updates** and can remotely **turn ON/OFF** the heater.

## 🎯 **System Requirements**
- 📱 **Mobile/Web App** – Users must register to access controls.
- 🌐 **Internet Connection** – Required for remote operation.
- 🔄 **Device Compatibility** – Works with IoT-enabled water heaters.
- ⏳ **Scheduling Support** – Automate heating times for efficiency.
